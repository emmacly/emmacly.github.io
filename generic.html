								<h3>The Vietnamese Students' Association</h3>
								<p>The Vietnamese Student's Association (VSA) is a student led club at the University of Calgary. Our mission is to foster a sense of community between Vietnamese students at the university and to provide them with a safe space to explore their connection to the culture. We host a few events every month, notably that of a Volleyball Tournament, Hoi Cho Tet, and Gala!</p>

								<p>Within the club, I am currently a consultant! This means that I routine between the various portfolios and aid other executives with their tasks. This ranges from things like media creation, acquiring sponsors, event planning, and marketing!</p>

								<h4>The GoldenZ Club</h4>
								<p>Similar to the VSA, the GoldenZ Club is a student run club at the University of Calgary. This club works to empower women through service and advocacy. We are directly partnered with the Women's Centre of Calgary, and work hard to fundraise and support women in need. Events are held once a month, and aim to fundraise money in order to create care packages that are later donated to the Women's Centre.</p>

								<p>I currently serve as one of the Directors of External Affairs for the GoldenZ club. My job is to acquire sponsors for club events and to foster all communication between the club and companies outside of the University. So far, I've contacted over 20 companies to secure donations for our events and have been able to facilitate these events through the donations that I acquire. </p>

								<h5> Science FUNdamentals </h5>
								<p> Science FUNdamentals is a registered charity and student group that aims to enhance elementary science education through interactive demonstrations. Students are paired with elementary classrooms throughout the city and showcase monthly presentations that engage students and foster an interest in science. </p>

								<p> As a general volunteer in this club, I work with a partner to create personalized demonstrations for Grade 5 students. My partner and I have worked tirelessly to lead classroom discussions and to facilitate a safe and welcoming environment where students feel comfortable enough to share opinions and answer questions throughout the presentation. It's an absolute blast and the kids really enjoy these presentations because of their interactive nature! <p>
