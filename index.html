                  						<h2>Hi, I'm Emma!<br /></h2>
                 						<p>I’m a fourth-year concurrent Kinesiology and Education major at the University of Calgary. I decided to become a teacher because I had incredible teachers growing up, many of whom I’m still connected with today. These teachers taught me the value of creating safe classroom spaces, where students feel comfortable, welcomed, and know that they belong. It’s in these classrooms that students can thrive and build meaningful connections with those around them. Additionally, I believe that teachers play an important role in modeling behaviours for students and showing them how to interact with the world around them. It can be easy to forget that students are constantly looking up to us and learning from everything we do, no matter how small. In this regard, I strive to be a positive role model for my students and to hold myself accountable when my actions are influenced by emotion or frustration.</p>
								
									<p> With classrooms becoming increasingly complex and students needing more individualized support, I aim to use what I’ve learned in class to support my students and meet them where they are. I’m a strong advocate for student autonomy and input. For example, I believe that working with students to create shared classroom expectations, or giving them the freedom to choose how they want to approach projects, empowers them to actively engage with their learning.  This allows students to feel respected and to take ownership of their learning. I also believe that all students should be given the same opportunities to grow, learn, and flourish both socially and academically. What works for one student may not work for another, and I’m always open to working directly with students to find learning strategies and tools that they can genuinely connect with. </p>
									<p> In my free time, I enjoy playing various sports and being active. I love playing volleyball, and I try to hike often during the summer. As a kinesiology major, I believe physical activity is one of the most important things that people can engage in. So, I try to be as active as I can! Outside of sports, I’m an avid lover of travelling and sitcoms!. My favourite shows are Modern Family, The Good Place, and Parks and Recreation. I would love to connect with students and staff through any of my interests!</p>

								<h3>Fostering Healthy Living</h3>
								<p> As a proud Kinesiology Major at the University of Calgary, I firmly believe in the value of being physically active while also acknowledging the barriers in place that prevent people from being as active as they may want to be. Thus, it is my goal to bridge this gap and show people the importance of physical wellbeing and how they can start being active. </p>

								<h3>Growth Through Collaboration</h3>
								<p>While being independent is an essential skill in the workforce, I believe that we grow the most when we are collaborating with others. Through our interactions with our peers and colleagues, we can better understand not only those around us, but also ourselves. This allows for continuous growth, as we allow others to challenge our beliefs and provide us with outside perspectives that we may not have initially considered.</p>

								<h3>Fair and Equal Education</h3>
								<p>As an aspiring teacher, and someone who is currently a coach, I believe that in order to truly do those around us justice, we must work with their best interests in mind. Our jobs as teachers and coaches are to foster growth and learning for those that we work with, and we can only do this by having the mindset that we must do all we can to make sure that they are given a fair and equal chance to succeed.</p>
