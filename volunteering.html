								<h3>The Vietnamese Students' Association</h3>
								<h5><i> November 2023 - Present</i></h5>
				
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Team_Photo.JPEG" alt="" /></span>The Vietnamese Student's Association (VSA) is a student led club at the University of Calgary. Our mission is to foster a sense of community between Vietnamese students at the university and to provide them with a safe space to explore their connection to the culture. We host a few events every month, notably that of a Volleyball Tournament, Hoi Cho Tet, and Gala!</p>

								<p>Within the club, I am currently a consultant! This means that I routine between the various portfolios and aid other executives with their tasks. This ranges from things like media creation, acquiring sponsors, event planning, and marketing!</p>

								<h3>The GoldenZ Club</h3>
								<h5><i> October 2023 - Present </i></h5>
				
								<p>Similar to the VSA, the GoldenZ Club is a student run club at the University of Calgary. This club works to empower women through service and advocacy. We are directly partnered with the Women's Centre of Calgary, and work hard to fundraise and support women in need. Events are held once a month, and aim to fundraise money in order to create care packages that are later donated to the Women's Centre.</p>

								<p>I currently serve as one of the Directors of External Affairs for the GoldenZ club. My job is to acquire sponsors for club events and to foster all communication between the club and companies outside of the University. So far, I've contacted over 20 companies to secure donations for our events and have been able to facilitate these events through the donations that I acquire. </p>

								<h3> Science FUNdamentals </h3>
								<h5><i> September 2022 - Present </i></h5>
				
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Knitter.jpg" alt="" /></span> Science FUNdamentals is a registered charity and student group that aims to enhance elementary science education through interactive demonstrations. Students are paired with elementary classrooms throughout the city and showcase monthly presentations that engage students and foster an interest in science. </p>

								<p> As a general volunteer in this club, I work with a partner to create personalized demonstrations for Grade 5 students. My partner and I have worked tirelessly to lead classroom discussions and to facilitate a safe and welcoming environment where students feel comfortable enough to share opinions and answer questions throughout the presentation. It's an absolute blast and the kids really enjoy these presentations because of their interactive nature! <p>

								<h3> Stars for Scholarly Youth </h3>
								<h5><i> September 2022 - Present </i></h5>
				
								<p> Stars for Scholarly Youth (SFSY) is a unique program whose mission is to bridge the gap between education and extracurricular opportunities for underserved Grade 5-12 youth. As a club we offer multiple programs, with our two most popular being the StarGATE Mentorship Program and the 1-on-1 Tutoring Program. <p>
					
								<p> I've been a part of SFSY for two years now and have been a part for both the tutoring and mentorship program. Within the tutoring program, I worked 1-on-1 with a Grade 11 student in the subjects of Biology 20, Math 20, and English 20. Each week we would work on a lesson together and I would keep track of if they were able to understand the material that week. With this information, I would tailor the next lesson to really make sure that all of the content I was helping them with was what they wanted and needed to learn. Results were seen immediately and the student was able to visibly grow in confidence as our sessions went on. As for mentoring, mentoring is not about teaching a student, but rather being someone that they can talk to for any inquires about school or life. My current mentee is a high school student who is hoping to pursue med school! It has been lovely being able to help them navigate and explore different pathways to medicine. In addition to this, being able to be there for someone in this way has felt truly impactful. <p>

								<h3> Ernest Morrow Middle School </h3>
								<h5><i> March 2022 - Present </i></h5>
						
								<p> For the past 2 years, I've been working along side the head coaches of Ernest Morrow Middle School to coach over 80 students in Grades 6, 7, 8, and 9. Working both independantly and collaboratively, I've diligently worked to plan and manage drills that teach fundamental badminton skills such as footwork, drives, drop shots, and positioning. <p>
					
								<p> I helped successfully lead the Grade 9 team to a first place victory against four other schools in 2023, in addition to also achieving first place victoris in 2022 with the Grade 8 and 9 teams. <p>

								<h3> Forest Lawn High School </h3>
								<h5><i> September 2021 - June 2022 </i></h5>

								<p> During my Grade 12 year, I was the teaching assistant for over 60 students in 2  different classes, English 20 and Culinary 20. For both classes, I helped teachers with material generation, lesson plan develoopment, class preparation, exam distribution, and student mentoring. In the English 20 class, I provided both individualized and small group support to reinforce classroom topics and promote student learning. <p>
