								<h3>Milk Jar Candle Co.</h3>
								<h5><i>January 2024</i></h5>

								<p>I am overjoyed to announce that I will be completing a practicum with Milk Jar Candle Co. as an Inclusion Specialist Assistant. In this position, I’ll be working closely with an assigned staff member to develop plans and strategies to help them succeed in their role. This practicum will take place in the Winter semester, beginning in January and ending in April. I genuinely could not be more excited for this opportunity! </p>

								<p>For context, I’ve loved Milk Jar for <i>years</i>. Way back when I was in high school, I bought my first Milk Jar candle and immediately felt drawn to the company due to their wonderful designs and amazing scents. It was later down the line when I learned about the company’s mission to foster inclusive and accessible work environments that I knew I wanted to get involved in some way. As a Kinesiology student, Milk Jar’s values deeply align with my own, and I could not think of a better company to work with. I just had to apply when I saw that they were accepting practicum students from the University of Calgary. When my practicum starts, I’ll be ready to give 110% to the company to contribute in any way that I can. </p>

								<h3>Calgary Board of Education</h3>
								<h5><i>April 2024- August 2024</i></h5>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/CBE.jpg" alt="" /></span>In the summer of 2024, I was given the amazing opportunity to join the Employee Health Resource Center (EHRC) at the Calgary Board of Education (CBE) It was an absolutely invaluable experience where I learned more than I could have imagined, and I was able to form connections with people that I never would have met otherwise. Truly, it was an amazing experience that I am beyond thankful for.</p>
								<p>I was tasked with creating Job Demand Assessments (JDAs) for all of the positions within the CBE. For context, JDAs are documents that outline the physical and cognitive aspects of any given job. They are used by physiotherapists, insurance companies, and employers to determine when employees are fit enough to return to work. They are also important for accommodation processes for staff. In the span of 4 months, I met with over 100 employees and conducted thorough interviews on more than 60 different positions. While there was a lot of trial and error along the way, I am very happy to share that I finished with over 45 completed JDAs. In addition to having these JDAs to show for my time with the CBE, I also have long lasting connections with many of the people that I was fortunate enough to meet and interview. It was truly an experience more wonderful than I could have ever asked for. I’ve never been more confident in my goal to become an educator with the CBE.</p>

								<h3> Hong Kong Food Market</h3>
								<h5><i>April 2018 - Present</i> </h5>

								<p>Growing up, I was fortunate enough to have a family business that provided me with unique opportunities that shaped my work ethic. For the past 6 years, I’ve been actively involved in our grocery store, and have taken on various roles throughout the years.  </p>
								<p>During Covid, a large issue that our store ran into was the lack of a website. While I did not have the tools at the time to design a website myself, I aided the team and played a pivotal role in inputting items into the company website. Over the span of two months, I inputted over 5000 items, ensuring that all labels and photos were correct and up to date so that our customers could have a seamless online shopping experience. While the website is now closed and we are no longer taking orders, I found that the added responsibility of taking on such a role really catapulted me to pursue more ambitious opportunities at work. </p>
								<p>Shortly after Covid, I took on a supervisory position at the store, where I was responsible for various operations and ensuring smooth day-to-day functioning. This role really deepened my understanding of what it meant to be a leader, and challenged me in ways that I truly wasn’t expecting. Dealing with both customer and employee issues helped me hone my leadership skills by forcing me to work on conflict management. Not only that, but working in such a dynamic role has improved my adaptability as well as my ability to multitask!  </p>
