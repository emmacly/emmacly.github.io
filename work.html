								<h2>Field Experience </h2>	
							<h3> Field II </h3>
								<p> During my first practicum, I had the opportunity to teach Grade 1–9 physical education, gaining experience in programming and planning lessons for a wide range of grade levels. I developed skills in lesson and unit plan creation, classroom management, and adapting activities to meet diverse student needs. I also focused on assessing student performance in areas such as skill development, participation, teamwork, and understanding of game rules, providing constructive feedback to help each student improve. Collaborating with my cooperating teacher and reflecting on each lesson allowed me to grow as an educator, learning how to create engaging, inclusive, and effective physical education experiences for all students.</p>

								<h2>Service Learning & Volunteer Teaching</h2>

								<h3>William Aberhart School</h3>

								<p>I am currently volunteering with the Complex Needs Educational Experience program at William Aberhart High School, supporting students in Grades 10–12 with diverse learning and adaptive behaviour needs. I have been working closely in the ACCESS and ALP (Adapted Learning Program) classes, providing individualized support to students with moderate to severe learning and adaptive behaviour challenges. </p>

<p>In this role, I assist in delivering personalized instruction and support functional academics, social communication, independence, daily living skills, and vocational development. I also help create an inclusive and supportive classroom environment, tailoring activities to each student’s abilities and interests and implementing accommodations such as assistive technology and structured learning supports.</p>

<p>Through this experience, I have gained skills in differentiating instruction, fostering inclusion, and adapting to a wide range of learning needs, strengthening both my flexibility and my ability to build meaningful connections with students.</p>

								<h3>St. Anne Academic Centre</h3>

								<p> I am currently volunteering at St. Anne Academic Centre in Calgary, a post–high school institution that supports students upgrading courses or completing their high school diploma. I work closely with a teacher in Science 30 and Math 20-3 classes, where I provide one-to-one and small group academic support to students with diverse learning needs, including many English Language Learners and students with Learner Support Plans. </p>

<p>Through this experience, I have developed skills in differentiating instruction and meeting learners where they are academically and personally. Many students come with varying levels of foundational skills, unique educational pathways, and complex life circumstances. My role involves building rapport, breaking down challenging concepts, adapting explanations, and helping students build both competence and confidence in Math and Science.</p>

<p>This placement has strengthened my flexibility, patience, and cultural competency, while deepening my understanding of how to support a wide range of learners in non-traditional and alternative education settings.</p>

							
								<h3> Science FUNdamentals </h3>
								
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Knitter.jpg" alt="" /></span> Science FUNdamentals is a registered charity and student group that aims to enhance elementary science education through interactive demonstrations. Students are paired with elementary classrooms throughout the city and showcase monthly presentations that engage students and foster an interest in science. </p>

								<p> There is a lot of freedom within this club to personalize how you want to present the demo kits, which means that there is a lot of room to take initiative and shape presentations to be exactly how you want them. Given this freedom, my partner and I have worked tirelessly to change the presentations in a way that we see fit. For many of the demos, we add extra slides to provide additional context to the content. I find that this really helps the students understand the content on a more fundamental level, so that they aren't just learning and forgetting the same day, but rather deeply understanding the material and remembering it later on. Furthermore, my partner and I put a significant amount of effort into making sure that we are facilitating a safe and welcoming environment where students feel comfortable enough to share their opinions and participate throughout the presentation. </p>
									
								<p>It's an absolute blast presenting and the kids really enjoy these presentations because of their interactive nature! Some presentations that we've done so far are Weather, Strawberry DNA, and Electricity! </p>
