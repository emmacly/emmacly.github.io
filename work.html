									<h3> Science FUNdamentals </h3>
								<h5><i> September 2022 - Present </i></h5>
				
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Knitter.jpg" alt="" /></span> Science FUNdamentals is a registered charity and student group that aims to enhance elementary science education through interactive demonstrations. Students are paired with elementary classrooms throughout the city and showcase monthly presentations that engage students and foster an interest in science. </p>

								<p> There is a lot of freedom within this club to personalize how you want to present the demo kits, which means that there is a lot of room to take initiative and shape presentations to be exactly how you want them. Given this freedom, my partner and I have worked tirelessly to change the presentations in a way that we see fit. For many of the demos, we add extra slides to provide additional context to the content. I find that this really helps the students understand the content on a more fundamental level, so that they aren't just learning and forgetting the same day, but rather deeply understanding the material and remembering it later on. Furthermore, my partner and I put a significant amount of effort into making sure that we are facilitating a safe and welcoming environment where students feel comfortable enough to share their opinions and participate throughout the presentation. </p>
									
								<p>It's an absolute blast presenting and the kids really enjoy these presentations because of their interactive nature! Some presentations that we've done so far are Weather, Strawberry DNA, and Electricity! </p>

								<h3> Stars for Scholarly Youth </h3>
								<h5><i> September 2022 - Present </i></h5>
				
								<p> Stars for Scholarly Youth (SFSY) is a unique program whose mission is to bridge the gap between education and extracurricular opportunities for underserved Grade 5-12 youth. As a club we offer multiple programs, with our two most popular being the StarGATE Mentorship Program and the 1-on-1 Tutoring Program. </p>
					
								<p> I've been a part of SFSY for two years now and have been a part for both the tutoring and mentorship program. Within the tutoring program, I worked 1-on-1 with a Grade 11 student in the subjects of Biology 20, Math 20, and English 20. Each week we would work on a lesson together and I would keep track of if they were able to understand the material that week. With this information, I would tailor the next lesson to really make sure that all of the content I was helping them with was what they wanted and needed to learn. Results were seen immediately and the student was able to visibly grow in confidence as our sessions went on. As for mentoring, mentoring is not about teaching a student, but rather being someone that they can talk to for any inquiries about school or life. My current mentee is a high school student who is hoping to pursue med school! It has been lovely being able to help them navigate and explore different pathways to medicine. In addition to this, being able to be there for someone in this way has felt truly impactful. </p>
