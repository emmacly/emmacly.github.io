								<h3>Calgary Board of Education</h3>
								<h5><i>April 2024- August 2024</i></h5>

								<p> I am absolutely thrilled to announce my upcoming role as a Summer HR Student in the health department at the Calgary Board of Education (CBE). This opportunity is from April to August, and I am beyond excited! </p>
								<p> As someone who is working towards a career in education, I see this as an incredible opportunity to not only expand my skill set but to also cultivate meaningful connections within the educational sphere. Being able to learn about the inner workings of the CBE is an invaluable opportunity that will only deepen my understanding of the educator’s role and the educational landscape as a whole. </p>

								<h3> Hong Kong Food Market</h3>
								<h5><i>April 2018 - Present</i> </h5>

								<p>Growing up, I was fortunate enough to have a family business that provided me with unique opportunities that shaped my work ethic. For the past 6 years, I’ve been actively involved in our grocery store, and have taken on various roles throughout the years.  </p>
								<p>During Covid, a large issue that our store ran into was the lack of a website. While I did not have the tools at the time to design a website myself, I aided the team and played a pivotal role in inputting items into the company website. Over the span of two months, I inputted over 5000 items, ensuring that all labels and photos were correct and up to date so that our customers could have a seamless online shopping experience. While the website is now closed and we are no longer taking orders, I found that the added responsibility of taking on such a role really catapulted me to pursue more ambitious opportunities at work. </p>
								<p>Shortly after Covid, I took on a supervisory position at the store, where I was responsible for various operations and ensuring smooth day-to-day functioning. This role really deepened my understanding of what it meant to be a leader, and challenged me in ways that I truly wasn’t expecting. Dealing with both customer and employee issues helped me hone my leadership skills by forcing me to work on conflict management. Not only that, but working in such a dynamic role has improved my adaptability as well as my ability to multitask!  </p>
